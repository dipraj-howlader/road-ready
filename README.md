Hi, This is Dipraj Howlader. Hope, You are fine..

This is my website named : "Road-Ready". Here is about hearing vehicles for riding.

First you have to sign up or you can continue with your google account. Then you do choose your current location and destination. Then , you will see your ride information.

I added features like - React Router, PrivateRouter, Google Login Authentication, Simple Email & Password Log in Authentication, Sign Up authentication, Context API, Google Map , Hover Effect, Dynamic Information and Images etc. It is responsive too. I request to use Google Pixel 2 phone for checking responsivity (Pixel Minimum : 320px). I used own created fake API also fakeData.

Here is my Live Website link : https://road-ready-6881f.web.app/
Thank you.
